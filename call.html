            <h1>Call for Papers</h1>

            <p>
              We invite contributions to BELIV 2022, the international forum to broadly discuss research methods in visualization. Our discussions span from novel and not-yet fully established design and evaluation methods for visualization tools and
              techniques, to methods that more generally establish the validity and scope of acquired visualization knowledge. BELIV supports contributions and discussions from the rich spectrum of visualization researchers, embracing the varied ways
              that researchers self-identify with respect to the main conference areas at VIS.
            </p>

            <p> <strong>This year:</strong> Complementary to the broad scope of BELIV and its general commitment to research methods, BELIV 2022 will include a timely focus topic:
              <strong>Designing and Evaluating Visualizations for an Ethical, Inclusive, and Responsible Future.</strong></p>

            <p>This topic is focused on considering how our visualization practices and processes can shape the future for the better or for the worse. As with all innovations, visualization and visualization research do not occur in a vacuum.
              Rather, as a community, we must consider how we can put ethics in the forefront of our research agendas and promote inclusivity in our research practices. We need to consider the contexts and challenges that lead to our visualization
              work, the means by which that work is realized, and how it can be leveraged for disparate purposes beyond what its original stakeholders envisioned. Ensuring that we contribute to an ethical, inclusive and responsible future means not
              just considering the grand challenges and directions of our community, but also how we as individual researchers shape the future for individuals, our communities, and societies. This line of thought is especially critical in light of
              how the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped (and has the potential to further reshape) how we perform our research, reflect on our impact, and conceive of our field. Many people are asking:<i>what will be the new normal?</i><br><br>

              We are interested in the practices and methods that visualization practitioners are deploying—and the discussions that they are having—to ensure that visualization contributes to the realization of a better future. To this end, we are
              soliciting papers that describe experiences and challenges in conducting visualization research and evaluations in ways that are ethical, inclusive, and responsible. Recommended paper topics include:

            <h1>Paper Types</h1>

            <p>
              The workshop focuses on contributions from all areas of visualization, including VAST, InfoVis, and SciVis.
              We accept 3 types of submissions— <emphasize>research</emphasize>, <emphasize>position</emphasize>, and <emphasize>survey</emphasize> papers:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Research papers</strong>
              im to make progress toward novel research methods in visualization and to discuss their benefits and limitations compared to traditional methodologies. As in past editions of BELIV, we will not accept papers that merely report on the
              use of a method or methodology unless the focus of the contribution is on lessons learned about applying a novel method and new insights on the method itself are presented. Research papers present new work and unpublished results on the
              topic areas of the workshop, including the focus topic. Research papers will be selected according to their novelty, quality, and relevance.


            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Position papers</strong>
              are problem discussions or statements describing the author's relevant experience and ideas in regards to methods and methodologies for visualization research, and in particular the focus topic of the workshop. Position papers will be
              selected according to their importance and relevance for the workshop topics, and how well they will fit the planned discussions.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Survey papers</strong>
              are intended to provide up-to-date and comprehensive surveys on topics relevant to methods and methodologies for visualization research. We welcome submissions that introduce emerging methodological approaches, as well as proposals on
              traditional research methods. We also welcome contributions from related disciplines and other application areas, including, but not limited to human-computer interaction, design, psychology, statistics, social science, computational
              sciences, etc. All survey papers, however, must make a clear case for their (potential) relevance to visualization.
            </p>

          </div>

          <div class="title">
            <h1>Format</h1>

            <p>
              Papers can include up to eight pages of content with additional pages for references only. Both full-length and shorter papers are welcome. The length of the submission should be commensurate with the contribution.
            </p>
            <p>
              All submissions should be formatted in the VGTC conference paper style. Suitable templates, in LaTeX and Word, can be downloaded
              from: <a href="https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/">https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/</a>. The submission, however, must be made in PDF format. Authors can decide whether they want to reveal
              their names on the submission (single-blind) or submit it anonymously (double-blind).
            </p>
