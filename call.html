            <h1>Call for Papers</h1>

            <p>
              We invite contributions to BELIV 2024, the international forum to broadly discuss research methods in visualization. Our discussions span from novel and not-yet fully established design and evaluation methods for visualization tools and techniques, to methods that more generally establish the validity and scope of acquired visualization knowledge. BELIV supports contributions and discussions from the rich spectrum of visualization researcher.
            </p>

            <p> <strong>This year:</strong> Complementary to the broad scope of BELIV and its general commitment to research methods, BELIV 2024 will include a timely focus topic:
              <strong>Rethinking Design, Evaluation, and Ethics in Visualization in the Era of Generative AI.</strong></p>

            <p>
              In the past two years (since the last iteration of BELIV), generative AI has become widely accessible, capturing the imaginations of broad groups from researchers, educators, and industry to everyday citizens. At the same time, generative AI promises to change the way that data visualizations are created, modeled, and evaluated. We find ourselves in a liminal space, not yet at the often-heralded future where generative AI is pervasive; we are at the dawn of the transition. It is against this background that we are at a critical juncture to shape how the visualization community will adopt and integrate generative AI into our everyday practices. How should and will visualization research evolve in response to generative AI?
            </p>
          <p class="list-title">Sample Topics:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Ethical implications and considerations of the use of generative AI in visualization in terms of labor, ecology, mis-/dis-information, or equity.</li>
              <li>Perspectives on attribution and ownership of designs created with / by generative AI</li>
              <li>Approaches to integrating generative AI into design processes and frameworks</li>
              Empirical characterizations of the benefits and challenges with leveraging generative AI to support design</li>
              <li>Reflections on the varied roles of generative AI in visualization work as a function of modality (e.g., image vs. language models)</li>
              <li>Perspectives on disclosing and characterizing the use of generative AI in research studies
              <li>Usages of generative AI in visualization evaluations</li>
              <li>Position papers or other agenda-setting works for creating a vision of visualization research in an AI-driven world</li>
          </ul>

            <h1>Paper Types</h1>

            <p>
              The workshop focuses on contributions from all areas of visualization, including VAST, InfoVis, and SciVis.
              We accept 3 types of submissionsâ€” <emphasize>research</emphasize>, <emphasize>position</emphasize>, and <emphasize>survey</emphasize> papers:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Research papers</strong>
              im to make progress toward novel research methods in visualization and to discuss their benefits and limitations compared to traditional methodologies. As in past editions of BELIV, we will not accept papers that merely report on the
              use of a method or methodology unless the focus of the contribution is on lessons learned about applying a novel method and new insights on the method itself are presented. Research papers present new work and unpublished results on the
              topic areas of the workshop, including the focus topic. Research papers will be selected according to their novelty, quality, and relevance.


            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Position papers</strong>
              are problem discussions or statements describing the author's relevant experience and ideas in regards to methods and methodologies for visualization research, and in particular the focus topic of the workshop. Position papers will be
              selected according to their importance and relevance for the workshop topics, and how well they will fit the planned discussions.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Survey papers</strong>
              are intended to provide up-to-date and comprehensive surveys on topics relevant to methods and methodologies for visualization research. We welcome submissions that introduce emerging methodological approaches, as well as proposals on
              traditional research methods. We also welcome contributions from related disciplines and other application areas, including, but not limited to human-computer interaction, design, psychology, statistics, social science, computational
              sciences, etc. All survey papers, however, must make a clear case for their (potential) relevance to visualization.
            </p>

          </div>

          <div class="title">
            <h1>Format</h1>

            <p>
              Papers can include up to eight pages of content with additional pages for references only. Both full-length and shorter papers are welcome. The length of the submission should be commensurate with the contribution.
            </p>
            <p>
              All submissions should be formatted in the VGTC conference paper style. Suitable templates, in LaTeX and Word, can be downloaded
              from: <a href="https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/">https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/</a>. The submission, however, must be made in PDF format. Authors can decide whether they want to reveal
              their names on the submission (single-blind) or submit it anonymously (double-blind).
